			<h3>Would you work with us on this heartfelt hint, gentle men?</h3>
			<p>We want the same things: High-strength, high-enthusiasm consent that's both (1) temporary and (2) incremental. Better and better sex, more often. Arousal safety is critically important for that, but trust us, we don't want to be critical. We especially don't want to be or seem harsh.</p>
			<p>We're hungry for better sex, with less and less unspoken irritation. So are you.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, we're sore, tired, or just thirsty for a drink, and need a break. If we want to say 'stop', it's not always easy to say so quickly and politely.</p>
			<h4>Drop and Lol! is better than this, right guys?</h4>

			<h4>Safeword soft powers; a tip you can tap-out on her chest!</h4>
			<p>You'll feel safer too. Communication is a two-way street. If you're cuddling and you just want to go to bed, tap twice or thrice on her heart. We'll know you want to stop, drop, and roll together into sleep. In case of emergency, if you ever need to rest, because you're feeling tired, sore, thirsty, or just plain exhausted, and you need a succubus break (just kidding, ladies), just triple tap or tap us twice, and we'll know you want to tap-out for a rollover stop or rest break, and relax, no questions asked, so as to make it easier to think without erect or aroused distractions on our minds.</p>

			<h4>Let's coordinate better bedside manner!</h4>
			<%= image_tag("lotsoflove2.jpg", class: "img-responsive", alt: "Happy couple rolled over into own parts of bed, each lying flat, happy with each other, looking at each other with curiosity") %>

			<p>So let's coordinate. Two taps or three taps is all anyone, whether male or female, needs for a stop, drop, and rollover, right?</p>

			<p><b>Q: Where's the best place to pillow-talk, laugh, and 'disambiguate'?</b></br>
			<b>A:</b> Holding hands, sharing heartfelt hints, alternating critical arousal, dearousal cycles in bed.</br> Together close your 'hot-cold empathy gaps'... all of 'em, empaths.</br></p>
			<h4>Calm and loving, and under half-mast, meets spec for "drop, flop, listen, (lol), and roll"!</h4>
			
			<p>It's objectively hard for men to listen very precautiously while at full-mast. So guys, if you feel two taps, turn really sensitive: make certain you go half-mast, or less, as quickly as you will, on your side of the bed.</p>

			<p>Or... if it's sized for one... you know what to do. Roll onto the floor, comically fast! 

			<p>We'll laugh at your earnestness to keep precaution at a max. If you're naked, put something on, then come back to make us laugh, and talk lovingly with us.. unless something quite serious went wrong. We'll let you know...</p>

			<p>Help lead the way, men, and make <em>dissent 'motor and mast' response</em> actionable, simpler, softer, and more measurable and concrete when <em>temporary, spoken, touch, or tacit consent</em> turns <em>even a little bit fuzzy</em>, if we're thirsty, fatigued, sore . . . or even feeling like saying "Yellow", or "Red", or "Stop". We'll feel more confident and comfortable, and the more responsive you are to touch with "Stop, Drop, and Lol", the more we'll feel like we're sleeping next to an extra-precautious "gentle man", someone who'll make us feel at a moment's notice like a "big, toasty cinnamon bun".</p>
